"""
Given Taylor series, a value of sine function can be approximated from
sin(x) \approx sum_{n=0}^{M-1} (-1)^n)/((2n+1)!) x^(2n+1),
where M is a number of terms. The larger M is,
the more accurate the approximate is. For example,
M = 5, sin(x) ≃x-x^3/3!+x^5/5!-x^7/7!+x^9/9!.
M =6, sin(x)≃x-x^3/3!+x^5/5!-x^7/7!+x^9/9!+x^11/11!.
Write a function, named approx_sin(x, tol),
to take 2 argument: x for an angle in radian and tol for tolerance.
The function computer approximate value of sin(x) for M terms such that
the last term in the series is smaller than the tolerance.
